      "Over the past few years, I've worked as a full-stack web developer at Supernova, collaborating with clients from all around the world. During this time, I've honed my skills in developing web applications using a variety of technologies and frameworks.\n\nMy experience includes designing and building user interfaces with modern frameworks such as React and Next.js, as well as creating scalable backends using Node.js and GraphQL. I've worked extensively with SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and also have experience with non-relational databases such as MongoDB and DynamoDB. In addition, I have worked with graph databases like Neo4j on several projects.\n\nI've had the opportunity to work on both group and standalone projects, which has helped me develop strong collaboration and communication skills. I'm comfortable working with other developers as well as independently on larger projects.\n\nOne of the highlights of my experience has been the opportunity to teach and mentor junior developers. I find it rewarding to share my knowledge and experience with others and help them develop their skills.\n\nFinally, I've deployed numerous web applications on AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, S3, SES, SQS, and Cognito. I'm comfortable working with AWS and have extensive experience deploying and managing applications on the platform.\n\nOverall, my experience as a full-stack web developer has been incredibly fulfilling, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with clients at Supernova to create innovative and high-quality web applications.",
